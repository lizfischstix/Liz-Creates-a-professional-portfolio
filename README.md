# Liz-Creates-a-professional-portfolio
A digital portfolio with samples of work I've created

##Description
This project is intended to display my web development skills to potential future employers.  This portfolio makes my contact information and work-samples easy for a busy hiring manager or recruter to look over quickly and get a sense of why I'm the right person for the job.  It is still a work in progress as I only had one previously deployed web app befor this, but as I continue to learn and grow I will have a place to desply my work and and also a place where I can reflect on how far I've come.

##Usage
Access the deployed web app at https://lizfischstix.github.io/Liz-Creates-a-professional-portfolio/
